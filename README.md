# Background
This study was conducted during my one-year apprenticeship at Actinvision, a period in which I also wrote my master’s thesis. Several factors led me to analyze the network structure of Actinvision. Early in my tenure, I was introduced to the company’s management framework—holacracy—and learned about recent changes in its implementation. Additionally, the company places a strong emphasis on social interactions, where employees are often recognized by their expertise in specific technologies like Tableau, Power BI, or Snowflake. Some are designated as tech leaders, serving as key points of contact for assistance with these tools. This unique managerial approach, combined with my interest in network science and the growing trend of using employee data to understand organizational dynamics, motivated me to conduct a network analysis of Actinvision’s social structure. My analysis aims to model the social network at Actinvision, compare the flow of information before and after the company’s restructuring, and identify key individuals or potential bottlenecks. The insights gained from this analysis could help further enhance cohesion and efficiency in the company’s daily interactions.
